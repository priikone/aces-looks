# Davinci CTL (DCTL) LMTs

The DCTL files in this directory are the DCTL versions of the CLF LMTs.  They are automatically generated from the CLF files and they provide same exact operations
(directly or indirectly) as the CLF versions.  These DCTL LMTs must be applied in ACES2065-1 AP0 linear space.
