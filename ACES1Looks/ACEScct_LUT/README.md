# ACEScct LUTs

LUTs in this directory are LUT versions of the LMTs.  All of these LUTs must be applied in ACEScct AP1 space, rather than in ACES2065-1 AP0 linear space.  They also output ACEScct values.

*NOTE: The LUTs may be more limiting than the corresponding CLF versions.  Using CLF version is preferred.*
